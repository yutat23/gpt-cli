# gpt-cli

gpt-cli is a Rust program that provides a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. The program takes input messages from the user and displays responses generated by the GPT-3.5-turbo model.

## Prerequisites

- Rust programming language installed
- OpenAI API key set in the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Execute the following command to build the program:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```
4. After the build is complete, execute the following command to run the program:
   ```
   cargo run [OPTIONS] [MESSAGE]
   ```

### Options:

- `-h`, `--help`: Show the help message and exit.
- `-t`, `--timeout`: Set the request timeout in seconds (default: 30).
- `-m`, `--message`: Set the input message for the chatbot.
  - `[MESSAGE]` will be used as the input message for the chatbot if no options are specified.
- `--max_tokens`: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response (default: 512).

## Example

```
cargo run -t 60 -m "Hello, gpt-cli!" --max_tokens 300
```

This command sets the timeout to 60 seconds, sends the message "Hello, gpt-cli!" to the chatbot, and sets the maximum number of tokens for the response to 300.

## Notes

Keep your OpenAI API key secret. Be careful not to accidentally expose it.
Using GPT-3.5-turbo may incur costs associated with your API key. Be mindful of your usage.
